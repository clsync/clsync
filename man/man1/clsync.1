.SH NAME
clsync \- live sync tool, written in GNU C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clsync [ ... ] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clsync
executes
.I sync\-handler
with appropriate arguments on FS events in directory
.I watch\-dir
using the
.BR inotify (7)
Linux kernel subsystem.

Extended regex\-rules to filter what files and
directories to sync may be placed in
.I rules\-file

.SH OPTIONS

This options can be passed as arguments or to be used in the configuration
file.

To disable numeric option set to zero:

is already syncing a huge file then all other syncs will be suspended
until the huge file syncing finish. To prevent this suspends you can use
"safe" or "full" threading mode.

.RE

Characteristics:
.RS

Theoretically is the best way. But may utilize of lot of CPU if
there's a lot of simultaneous parallel syncs. (also this way is not well
tested)
.RE
.IR full

.RE

.RE

If you're running

.br
.I syslog
.RE

Default value is "stderr".
.RE

.B \-\-one\-file\-system
.RS 8
Don't follow to different devices' mount points. This option just adds option
"FTS_XDEV" for
.BR fts_open (3)
function.

.B Warning!
If you're using this option (but no \-\-exclude\-mount\-points)
.B clsync
will write neither includes nor excludes of content of mount points.

This may cause problems e.g. you're using rsync for sync-handler without
similar option "\-\-one\-file\-system".

Is not set by default.
.RE

.B \-X, \-\-exclude\-mount\-points
.RS 8
Forces

.B DANGEROUS OPTION. This functionality wasn't tested well. You can lost your data.

Enables inter-node notifing subsystem to prevent sync looping between nodes.
This's very useful features that provides ability of birectional sync of the
same directory between two or more nodes.
.I interface-ip
is an IP-address already assigned to the interface that will be used for
multicast notifing.

Not enabled by default.

To find out the IP-address on interface "eth0", you can use for example next
command:

Sets synchronization iterations limit. One iteration means one sync-handler
execution.

.I iterations\-count
.RS 8
set to 0 means no limit (infinite loop).

set to 1 means that only initial sync will be done

set to n means that only initial sync and (n-1) sync-ups after that will be done
.RE

Hint: This option may be useful in conjunction with \-\-exit\-on\-no\-events
to prevent infinite sync-up processes.

Default value is "0".

.RE

.PP
.B \-B, \-\-threshold\-bigfile
.I filesize\-threshold
.RS 8
Sets file size threshold (in bytes) that separates ordinary files from
"big files". Events about "big files" are processed in another queue with a
separate collecting delay. This is supposed to be used as a means of unloading
IO resources.

Default value is "134217728" ["128 MiB"].
.RE

.PP
.B \-L, \-\-lists\-dir
.I tmpdir\-path
.RS 8
Sets directory path to output temporary events\-lists files.

If this option is enabled,
.B clsync
will execute
.I sync\-handler
once for each aggregated event list, passing the path to a file containing
this list (actions "synclist" and "rsynclist").
Otherwise,
.B clsync
will execute
.I sync\-handler
for every file in the aggregated event list (action "sync").

Cannot be used in mode "so".

See

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-\-have\-recursive\-sync

.I rsync\-includes\-line\-limit
.RS 8
Sets soft limit for lines count in files by path
.IR rsync\-listpath .
Unfortunately, rsync works very slowly with huge "\-\-include\-from"
files. So,
.B clsync
splits that list with approximately
.I rsync\-includes\-line\-limit
lines per list if it's too big, and executes by one rsync instance per list
part. Use value "0" to disable the limit.

Default value is "20000".
.RE

.PP
.B \-\-rsync\-prefer\-include
.RS 8
Forces
.B clsync
to prefer a "lot of includes" method instead of a "excludes+includes" for
rsync on recursive syncing.

See cases
.BR rsyncshell ,
.B rsyncdirect

.BR "SYNC HANDLER MODES" .

This option is not recommended.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-x, \-\-ignore\-exitcode
.I exitcode
.RS 8
Forces
.B clsync
to do not process exitcode
.I exitcode
of
.I sync\-handler
as an error. You can set multiple ignores by passing this option multiple
times.

Recommended values for rsync case is "24". You can set multiple values with
listing a lot of "\-x" options (e.g. "\-x 23 \-x 24") or via commas
(e.g. "\-x 23,24"). To drop the list use zero exitcode (e.g. "\-x 0"). For
example you can use "\-x 0,23" to drop the list and set "23"-th exitcode to
be ignored.

Is not set by default (or equally is set to "0").

.B \-F, \-\-full\-initialsync
.RS 8
Ignore filter rules from

.PP
.B \-\-exit\-on\-no\-events
.RS 8
Exit if there's no events. Works like
.IR \-\-only\-initialsync ,
but also syncs events collected while the initial syncing.

Unlike
.I \-\-only\-initialsync
this option uses FS monitor subsystem to monitor for new events while the initial syncing. This may reduce performance. On the other hand this way may be used to be sure, that everything is synced at the moment before clsync will exit.

Is not set by default.

.RE

The execution will be skipped if syncing process wasn't started.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose

.PP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
.RS 8
Increases debugging output. This may be supplied multiple times for more

sync
.I label evmask path [nodes]

In this case,

In this case,
.I sync\-handler
is supposed to non\-recursively sync files and directories from list in a file
by path
.I listpath
(see below). With

it's passed bitmask of events with the file or directory (see

.RS
In this case there's no direct exec*() calling. In this case

.I sync-handler
as a shared library with
.BR dlopen (3)
and calls function "int clsyncapi_rsync(const char *inclist, const char *exclist)" from it
for every sync.
.br
.B inclist
is a path to file with rules for "\-\-include\-from" option of rsync. This argument is always not NULL.
.br
.B exclist
is a path to file with rules for "\-\-exclude\-from" option of rsync. This argument is NULL if

.br
.I "Excludes takes precedence over includes."

Also may be defined functions "int clsyncapi_init(options_t *, indexes_t *)"
and "int clsyncapi_deinit()" to initialize and deinitialize the syncing
process by this shared object.

To fork the process should be used function
"pid_t clsyncapi_fork(options_t *)" instead of "pid_t fork()" to make clsync
be able to kill the child.

See example file "clsync-synchandler-rsyncso.c".

Also may be defined functions "int clsyncapi_init(options_t *, indexes_t *)"
and "int clsyncapi_deinit()" to initialize and deinitialize the syncing
process by this shared object.

To fork the process should be used function
"pid_t clsyncapi_fork(options_t *)" instead of "pid_t fork()" to make clsync
be able to kill the child.

See example file "clsync-synchandler-so.c".

Recommended case.

.SH RULES
Filter riles can be placed into
.I rules\-file
with one rule per line.

Rule format:
.I [+\-][fdw*]regexp

.I +
\- means include;
.I \-
\- means exclude;
.I f
\- means file;
.I d
\- means directory;
.I w
\- means walking to directory;
.I *
\- means all.

For example: \-*^/[Tt]est

It's not recommended to use
.I w
rules in modes "rsyncdirect", "rsyncshell" and "rsyncso".
.BR rsync (1)
allows one to set syncing and walking only together in "\-\-include" rules
("\-\-files\-from" is not appropriate due to problem with syncing files
deletions). So there may be problems with clsync's
.I w
rules in this cases.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Initial rsync process works very slow on clsync start
.RS
Probably there's too huge exclude list is passed to rsync. This can happened
if you're excluding with regex in clsync's rules a lot of thousands files.
They will be passed to rsync's exclude list one by one.

To diagnose it, you can use "\-U" option and look into 
.I rsync\-exclude\-listpath
file (see
.B "SYNC HANDLER"
case 
.BR d )

To prevent this, it's recommended to write such rules for rsync directly 
(not via clsync).

For example, often problem is with PHP's session files. You shouldn't exclude
them in clsync's rules with "\-f/sess_.*", but you should exclude it in rsync
directly (e.g with «\-\-exclude "sess_*"»).
.RE

The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

Error: Cannot inotify_add_watch() on [...]: No space left on device (errno:
28)
.RS
Not enough inotify watching descriptors is allowed. It can be fixed
by increasing value of "sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches"
.RE

Error: Got non-zero exitcode
.I exitcode
[...]
.RS
.I sync\-handler
returned non-zero exitcode. Probably, you should process exitcodes in it or
your syncer process didn't worked well. I case of using rsync, you can find
the exitcodes meanings in
.BR "man 1 rsync" .

If
.I exitcode
equals to 23 and you're using
.B clsync
in conjunction with
.BR rsync ,
this may happend, for example in next cases:

.RS

\- Not enough space on destination.

\- You're running clsync with 
.B \-\-threading
and rsync with
.BR \-\-backup .
See bugreport by URL:
.IR https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10081 .

.RE

To confirm the problem, you can try to add "return 0" or "exit 0" into
your
.IR sync\-handler .

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

.B clsync
supports configuration file.

By default
.B clsync
tries to read next files (in specified order):
.RS
~/.clsync.conf
.br
/etc/clsync/clsync.conf
.RE

This may be overrided with option
.IR \-\-config\-file .

.B clsync
reads only one configuration file. In other words, if option
.I \-\-config\-file
is not set and file
.B ~/.clsync.conf
is accessible and parsable,
.B clsync
will not try to open
.BR /etc/clsync/clsync.conf .
Command line options have precedence over config file options.

Configuration file is parsed with glib's g_key_file_* API. That means,
that config should consits from groups (blocks) of key-value lines as in the
example:
.RS
[default]
.br
background = 1
.br
mode = rsyncshell
.br
debug = 0
.br
output = syslog
.br
label = default
.br
pid\-file = /var/run/clsync\-%label%.pid


[debug]
.br
config\-block\-inherits = default
.br
debug = 5
.br
background = 0
.br
output = stderr


[test]
.br
mode=rsyncdirect
.br
debug=3
.RE

Also glib's
.B gkf
API doesn't support multiple assignments. If you need to list some values
(e.g. exitcodes) just list them with commas in single assignment
(e.g. "ignore\-exitcode=23,24").

In this example there're 3 blocks are set - "default", "debug" and "test".
And block "debug" inherited setup of block "default" except options "debug",
"background" and "output".

By default
.B clsync
uses block with name "default". Block name can be set by option
.IR \-\-config\-block .

.SH EXAMPLES
Working examples you can try out in "/usr/share/doc/clsync/examples/"
directory. Copy this directory somewhere (e.g. into "/tmp"). And try to run
"clsync-start-rsync.sh" in there. Any files/directories modifications in
"testdir/from" will be synced to "testdir/to" with few seconds delay.
