.SH NAME
clsync \- live sync tool, written on GNU C
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B clsync [\-bpvDqfih] 
.B [\-t
.I ordinary\-delay
.B ]
.B [\-w
.I additional\-delay
.B ]
.B [\-d
.I tmpdir\-path

.B [\-t
.I bigfiles\-delay
.B ]
.B [\-l
.I label
.B ]
.I watch\-dir
.I action\-script
.B [
.I rules\-file
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clsync
executes
.I action\-script
with appropriate arguments on FS events in directory
.I watch\-dir
using the
.BR inotify (7)
Linux kernel subsystem.

Extended regex\-rules to filter what files and
directories to sync may be placed in
.I rules\-file


.SH OPTIONS

.B \-b, \-\-background
.RS 8
Daemonize, forcing clsync to fork() on start.

.PP
.RE
.B \-p, \-\-pthread
.RS 8
Use
.BR pthreads (7)
to parallelize syncing processes.
.RE

.PP
.B \-t, \-\-collectdelay
.I ordinary\-delay
.RS 8
Sets the delay (in seconds) to collect events about ordinary files and
directories. Total maximum delay for ordinary files and
directories will be
.I ordinary\-delay
+
.I additional\-delay
seconds.

Default value is "30".
.RE

.PP
.B \-w, \-\-commondelay
.I additional\-delay
.RS 8
Sets the additional delay (in seconds) to collect events about any file
or directory.

Default value is "15".
.RE

.PP
.B \-d, \-\-outlistsdir
.I tmpdir\-path
.RS 8
Sets directory path to output temporary events\-lists files.

If this option is enabled,
.B clsync
will execute
.I action\-script
only once per aggregated events list with passing path to a file with the
list (action "synclist").
Otherwise,
.B clsync
will execute
.I action\-script
per every file in aggregated events list (action "sync").

See
.B ACTION SCRIPT
\*S.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-R, \-\-rsync
.RS 8
Forces
.B clsync
to use "rsynclist" action instead of "initialsync" and "synclist" (see 
.B ACTION SCRIPT
). This option can be used only with
.I \-\-outlistsdir
option.

Recommended option.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-L, \-\-rsyncinclimit
.I rsync\-includes\-line\-limit
.RS 8
Sets soft limit for lines count in files by path
.I rsync\-listpath
\*S. Unfortunately, rsync works very slowly with huge "\-\-include\-from" files.
So,
.B clsync
splits that list with approximately
.I rsync\-includes\-line\-limit
lines per list if it's too big, and executes by one rsync instance per list
part.

Default value is "20000".
.RE

.PP
.B \-I, \-\-rsyncpreferinclude
.RS 8
Forces
.B clsync
to prefer a "lot of includes" method instead of a "excludes+includes" for rsync on recursive
syncing.

See
.B case d
of
.B ACTION SCRIPT
\*S.

This option is not recommended.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-U, \-\-dontunlinklists
.RS 8
Do not delete list\-files after
.I action\-script
has finished.

Is not set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-B, \-\-bigfilethreshold
.I filesize\-threshold
.RS 8
Sets file size threshold (in bytes) that separates ordinary files from
"big files". Events about "big files" are processed in another queue with
separate collecting delay. This is supposed to be used as means for unloading IO
resources.

Default value is "134217728" ["128 MiB"].
.RE

.PP
.B \-T, \-\-bigfilescollectdelay
.I bigfiles\-delay
.RS 8
Sets the delay (in seconds) to collect events about "big files" (see
.I filesize\-threshold
). Total maximum delay for "big files" will be 
.I bigfiles\-delay
+
.I additional\-delay
seconds.

Default value is "1800".
.RE

.PP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
.RS 8
This option is supposed to increase verbosity. But at the moment there's no
"verbose output" in the code, so the option does nothing. :)
.RE

.PP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
.RS 8
Increases debugging output. Maximum debugging output will be with
three or more "d" flags, for example: \-ddd
.RE

.PP
.B \-q, \-\-quite
.RS 8
Suppresses error messages.
.RE

.PP
.B \-f, \-\-fanotify
.RS 8
Switches monitor subsystem to "fanotify" [it's described for
future\-compatibility].
.I Don't_use_this_option!
.RE

.PP
.B \-i, \-\-inotify
.RS 8
Switches monitor subsystem to "inotify".

Is set by default.
.RE

.PP
.B \-l, \-\-label
.I label
.RS 8
Sets a label for this instance of clsync. The
.I label
will be passed to
.I action\-script
every execution.

Default value is "nolabel".
.RE

.PP
.B \-h, \-\-help
.RS 8
Outputs options list and exits with exitcode "0".
.RE

.PP
.B \-V, \-\-version
.RS 8
Outputs clsync version and exits with exitcode "0".
.RE

.SH ACTION SCRIPT
.B clsync
executes
.I action\-script
that supposed to take care of the actual syncing process. Therefore
.B clsync
is only a convenient way to run a syncing script.

.B clsync
can run
.I action\-script
in four ways:

case
.B a
.RS
.I action\-script
initialsync
.I label dirpath

In this case,
.I action\-script
is supposed to recursively sync data from directory by path
.I dirpath
with manual excluding extra files.
.RE

case
.B b
.RS
.I action\-script
sync
.I label evmask path

In this case,
.I action\-script
is supposed to non\-recursively sync file or directory by
.I path
\*S. With
.I evmask
it's passed bitmask of events with the file or directory (see 
"/usr/include/linux/inotify.h").
.RE

case
.B c
.RS
.I action\-script
synclist
.I label listpath

In this case,
.I action\-script
is supposed to non\-recursively sync files and directories from list in a file by
path
.I listpath
\*S(see below). With
.I evmask
it's passed bitmask of events with the file or directory (see 
"/usr/include/linux/inotify.h").
.RE

case
.B d
.RS
.I action\-script
rsynclist
.I label rsync\-listpath [rsync\-exclude\-listpath]

In this case,
.I action\-script
is supposed to run "rsync" application with parameters: 

\-aH \-\-delete\-before \-\-include\-from
.I rsync\-listpath
\-\-exclude '*'

if option
.I \-\-rsyncpreferinclude
is enabled.

And with parameters:

\-aH \-\-delete\-before \-\-exclude\-from
.I rsync\-exclude\-listpath
\-\-include\-from
.I rsync\-listpath
\-\-exclude '*'

if option
.I \-\-rsyncpreferinclude
is disabled.
.RE

As can be noticed, in all four cases clsync's
.I label
is passed (see 
.I \-\-label
).

The
.I listfile
contains one or more lines separated by NL (without CR) of next format:
.RS
sync
.I label evmask path

Every lines is supposed to be proceed by external syncer to sync file or
directory by path
.I path
\*S. With
.I evmask
it's passed bitmask of events with the file or directory (see
"/usr/include/linux/inotify.h").

.RE

.SH RULES
Filter riles can be placed into
.I rules\-file
with one rule per line.

Rule format:
.I [+\-][fd*]regexp

.I +
\- means include;
.I \-
\- means exclude;
.I f
\- means file;
.I d
\- means directory;
.I *
\- means all.

For example: \-*/[Tt]estdir

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The following diagnostics may be issued on stderr:

Error: Cannot inotify_add_watch() on [...]
.RS
Not enough watching descriptors of inotify is allowed. It can be fixed
by increasing value of "sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches"
.RE
.SH EXAMPLES
Working example you can try out in "example/" or 
"/usr/share/doc/clsync/example/" directory. Copy this directory somewhere
(e.g. into "/tmp"). And try to run "clsync-start.sh" in there. Any
files/directories modifications in "example/testdir/from" will be synced to
"example/testdir/to" with few seconds delay.
